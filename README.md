## 🎯 About This Repository

This repository serves as a **permanent archive** of my professional works and a **CDN for my internet projects**.  
It contains all my legally created content: video productions, advertising campaigns, website designs, graphic works, and other multimedia files created throughout my career.

Think of it as a **digital time capsule** — preserving my creative legacy independently of changing platforms and hosting services.
